Learning a new programming language is comparable to learning to speak a foreign language. You have to deal with new vocabulary, grammar, and language
idioms. But this initial effort pays off multiple times. With the new language,
you  find  unique  ways  to  express  yourself,  you’re  exposed  to  new  concepts  and styles that add to your personal abilities, and you may even explore new perspec-
tives on your world. This is what Groovy did for us, and we hope Groovy will do it
for you, too.
学习一门新的编程语言相当于学习外语。你得学习新的发音，语法，俗语。刚开始学习的时候会花费大量的时间。
学习新语言的过程中，你会找到独到的表达自己的方式，为自己的技能添加新的概念与风格，甚至可能打开一个新世界。
 The first part of this book introduces you to the language basics: the Groovy
syntax,  grammar,  and  typical  idioms.  We  present  the  language  by  example  as
opposed to using an academic style. 
这书的第一部分会介绍这个语言的语法与习惯用法。
我们通过示例去讲解这门语言，而不会使用那种枯燥的学院风格。
  You  may  skim  this  part  on  first  read  and  revisit  it  before  going  into  serious development with Groovy. If you decide to skim, please make sure you visit chapter 2 and its examples. They are cross-linked to the in-depth chapters so you can
easily look up details about any topic that interests you.
 One of the difficulties of explaining a programming language by example is
that you have to start somewhere. No matter where you start, you end up needing to use some concept or feature that you haven’t explained yet for your examples.
你可以在略读时忽略这一章，在实际开发前应读一下。如果你决定忽略它，请认真阅读第二章及其中包含的示例。
它们对一些深入的章节有说明，在这里你应该能发现一些你感兴趣的东西。
通过举例讲解一门编程语言有个不好的地方就是得从指定的位置开始。还有就是无论你从哪里开始，都会在例子用到没有讲解的概念与特性。


Section 2.3 serves to resolve this perceived deadlock by providing a collection of self-explanatory warm-up examples. 
第2.3节会提供一系列通俗易懂的例子来打破这僵局。
 We explain the main portion of the language using its built-in datatypes and introduce expressions, operators, and keywords as we go along. 
 By starting with some of the most  familiar  aspects  of  the  language  and  building  up  your  knowledge  in  stages,  we hope you’ll always feel confident when exploring new territory.
我们会使用这语言的内置数据类型讲解这门语言的主要内容，并在这个过程中介绍它的表达式，操作符，关键字。
通过从编程语言最熟悉的方面逐步地建立你Groovy相关知识, 我们希望你在探索它的过程中充满信心。

 Chapter 3 introduces Groovy’s practical approach to typing, examines the numeric and
other primitive types that Groovy supports, and discusses strings and regular expressions.


 Chapter 4 continues looking at Groovy’s rich set of built-in types, examining those
with a collection-like nature: ranges, lists, and maps.
 Chapter 5 builds on the preceding sections and provides an in-depth description
of the closure concept. 
 Chapter 6 touches on logical branching, looping, and shortcutting program exe-
cution flow. 
 Chapter 7 sheds light on the way Groovy builds on Java’s object-oriented features
adding support for multimethods and traits.
 Chapter 8 looks at Groovy’s dynamic programming capabilities.
 Chapter 9 dives into compile-time metaprogramming and AST transformations.
 Chapter 10, the final chapter in part 1, discusses Groovy as a static language.
 At the end of part 1, you’ll have the whole picture of the Groovy language. This is
the  basis  for  getting  the  most  out  of  part  2,  which  explores  the  Groovy  library:  the
classes and methods that Groovy adds to the Java platform. Part 3, “Applied Groovy,”
leads you through places where the power of Groovy is put into action.
